### Major Update: Simple Light Soft Refactoring

We have completely redesigned the **Simple Light Soft** theme to provide a true "Reader Mode" experience, focusing on eye comfort and accessibility.

- **New Background**: Adopted the classic Safari Reader Mode color (`#F8F1E3`) for a paper-like reading experience.
- **Cool-on-Warm Color Strategy**:
  - Replaced "hot" colors (Yellow, Bright Red, Orange) with "cool" complementary colors (Purple, Crimson, Burnt Orange) to reduce visual fatigue on the warm background.
  - **Yellow** -> **Deep Purple** (`#6A1B9A`): Provides excellent contrast and a refreshing look.
  - **Tomato/Red** -> **Crimson** (`#B71C1C`): A cooler, deeper red that is less alarming.
  - **Orange** -> **Burnt Orange** (`#A05A00`): Retains the "Parameter" identity but with a comfortable autumn tone.
- **Enhanced Accessibility (WCAG AA)**:
  - All syntax highlighting colors have been calibrated to pass WCAG AA contrast standards (> 4.5:1) on the new soft background.
  - **Functions**: Optimized to **Forest Green** (`#00753B`) for perfect clarity.
  - **Variables**: Adjusted to **Deep Teal** (`#005A65`) to distinguish from functions.
  - **Types**: Tuned to **Blue-Teal** (`#00788A`) for clear semantic distinction.
- **UI Consistency**:
  - Sidebar and Activity Bar colors are now perfectly harmonized with the editor background, creating a unified "physical desk" visual hierarchy.

### Improvements

- **String Color**: Unified string color to **Crimson** (`#B71C1C`) in Soft Light mode for better consistency and readability.
- **General**: Codebase cleanup and better color definitions for easier maintenance.
